**Since 10/2023 github enforces a two-factor or multi-factor authentication, which is neither required in principle nor comfortable in daily use of a code repository. This was introduced for economical reasons (Microsoft as github owner sells 2FA/MFA software solutions and want to remove non-profit, i.e., low-impact, repositories), higher user control, and not for security primarily, and leads to an unnecessary collection of sensitive personal data and linking of services that should be rejected by users and developers.**
